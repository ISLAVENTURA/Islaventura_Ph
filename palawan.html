              <p><br>Palawan is the kind of place that lingers in memory long after the trip is over. It’s not just the water or the limestone cliffs but it’s the entire island. The island has a way of making people slow down, breathe deeper, and simply look around in awe. Travelling to Palawan, it started with a short flight from Manila to Puerto Princesa. Even before landing, we could already see the hints of what was to come: green mountains rising from the sea and coastlines that seemed untouched. The airport was small and laid-back, a sign that things here moved at a different pace. Palawan is long and narrow, with its most famous spots scattered along the coastline. From Puerto Princesa, the van ride to El Nido took about six hours. It wasn’t the smoothest road on the way, but it offered a glimpse of local life, kids playing by the roadside, carabaos in rice fields, and rows of coconut trees lining the way. It felt remote but alive. 
<br>
<br>
El Nido felt like the heart of the island. The town itself was simple, with narrow streets, motorbikes passing by, and shops selling everything from snorkeling gear to fresh mangoes. But what really stood out were the tours. Joining one the next morning, hopping on a small bangka boat with a few other travelers. That day, exploring hidden beaches, swam in lagoons that looked unreal, and had lunch on the sand. It wasn’t luxury yet it was all real, and it was beautiful. Coron, on the other hand, had a different charm. A fast ferry from El Nido, and the ride took a few hours. Coron was quieter, a little more rocky, and known for its wreck diving. Kayangan Lake was another highlight, reaching it involved a short hike, but the view from the top was worth every step. The lake itself was so clear it looked like glass.

<br>
<br>
In the evenings, there were small bars where locals and tourists mingled, sharing stories over cold beers. No loud parties, just soft music and sea breeze. What was surprising was how much Palawan cared about the environment. Most tours had rules about not touching corals, avoiding plastic, and respecting marine life. It showed that people here valued their natural treasures and wanted them to last. The island offered a lot: peace, beauty, and a sense of connection to nature. It wasn’t just a trip. It was a reset. And as the plane took off for home, looking down at the islands below, already thinking about when to return.
